{{! Template alternative }}
{{! As well as the shiny new tag.hbs template, Ghost now also supports custom templates for your individual pages giving you tight control over exactly how your static pages render. If you have a special page on your blog called 'About' with the url /about/, you can create a template called page-about.hbs with a custom layout and this template will only be used to render the About page, and nothing else.
